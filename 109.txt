Normal distributions are the
most interesting pattern in data
science. We'll learn to use the
learnings you just had about normal
distributions in lots of interesting data
analysis and machine learning
algorithm.



properties of Normal Distribution(Data set which follows normal distribution)
1.The Mean,Median,mode are all equal in a normal distribution and they are at thr peak

2.y axis is the probablity
3.symetrical nature of normal distribution,mean dividesinto 2 equal parts
3.
68% of data lies within 1 standard deviation(between mean-sd to mean+sd)
95% of data lies within 2 standard deviations(between mean-2sd to mean+2sd)
99% of data lies within 3 standard deviations(between mean-3sd to mean+3sd)
